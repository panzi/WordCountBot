WordCountBot
============

Very simple IRC bot that counts mentioned words in the last X seconds. A word is
only counted once per user and channel. This can be used to do simple votings
where the users have to mention the thing they vote for in chat and then you get
the counts with the command `!count THING1 THING2 THING3`.

This bot will be active on Twitch under https://www.twitch.tv/wordcountbot, but
isn't right now. If you want this bot to join your channel go to the linked
channel and enter `!join YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME`. You have to be the channel owner or
a mod of `YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME`.

Running the Bot
---------------

In case you run this bot yourself see `config.yaml.example` for an example
configuration. The actual configuration file has to be named `config.yaml` or
has to be passed via the `--config` argument to the script. If you use this bot
with Twitch you need to provide the OAuth token as the password, which you can
get [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
